# StockMarketPrediction
Apache Kafka and Facebook Prophet to generate short-term stock market predictions.

Of course, in this code, the producer and consumer are both locally hosted on the same computer, so there is no real need for Kafka. However, if we replace the Producer port with the actual port that is producing real-time stock market data, Kafka will become useful and we will no longer need to use the Alpha Vantage API.
